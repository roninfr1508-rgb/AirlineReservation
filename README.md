# Assignment 2 – Airline Reservation Portal

## Project Description
This project is a simple Java application that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming principles.  
The system works with people data (Passenger, Student) and shows how abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism are applied.  
The project also includes searching, filtering, and basic data handling using collections.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Make sure JDK is installed.
3. Run the `Main` class.
4. The output will be displayed in the console.



 ## Implemented Assignment Requirements
 1.Data abstraction (abstract class `Person`, interface `Identifiable`)
 2.Encapsulation (private fields, getters and setters)
 3.Inheritance (`Passenger` extends `Person`)
 4.Polymorphism (using `Identifiable` interface and method overriding)
 5. Organizing data using collections (`ArrayList`)
 6.Searching data (find passenger by name)
 7.Filtering data (filter passengers by age)
 8.Overriding `toString()` method
 9.Overriding `equals()` method
 10/Overriding `hashCode()` method
